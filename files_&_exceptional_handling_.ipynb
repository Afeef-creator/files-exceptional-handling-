        "*THEORY QUESTIONS*\n",
        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line at runtime, while compiled languages convert the entire code into machine code before execution.\n",
        "  - Interpreted languages are generally slower but more flexible.\n",
        "  - Compiled languages offer faster execution and better optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Exception handling is a mechanism to manage runtime errors without stopping the program.\n",
        "  - It uses try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n",
        "  - It ensures smooth program execution even when errors occur.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The finally block runs whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
        "  - It is used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "  - Logging records events, errors, and information during program execution.\n",
        "  - It helps in debugging and monitoring applications.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. What is the significance of the del method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __del__() method is a destructor that runs when an object is deleted.\n",
        "  - It helps clean up resources like files or memory.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "  - import module loads the entire module.\n",
        "  - from module import function loads only specific components.\n",
        "  - The second form avoids prefixing the module name.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "  - Use multiple except blocks for different errors.\n",
        "  - Or catch multiple exceptions in a single except using tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        " 8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "  - It automatically opens and closes files.\n",
        "  - Ensures cleanup even if an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        " 9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "  - Multithreading runs multiple threads within one process (shared memory).\n",
        "  - Multiprocessing runs separate processes with separate memory.\n",
        "  - Multiprocessing avoids GIL limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        " 10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "  - Helps in debugging.\n",
        "  - Records errors and important events.\n",
        "  - Useful for auditing and monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        " 11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - It manages the allocation and deallocation of memory automatically.\n",
        "  - Includes garbage collection and reference counting.\n",
        "\n",
        " 12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Write code in a try block.\n",
        "  - Handle errors in except blocks.\n",
        "  - Optional else block for code that runs if no error occurs.\n",
        "  - Optional finally block for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        " 13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "  - Prevents memory leaks.\n",
        "  - Ensures efficient program execution.\n",
        "  - Helps with performance optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        " 14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "  - try block contains risky code.\n",
        "  - except block catches and handles the error.\n",
        "\n",
        " 15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "  - Uses reference counting to track object usage.\n",
        "  - Cyclic garbage collector removes unused circular references automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        " 16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - Runs only if no exception occurs in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        " 17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "  - DEBUG\n",
        "  - INFO\n",
        "  - WARNING\n",
        "  - ERROR\n",
        "  - CRITICAL\n",
        "\n",
        " 18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "  - os.fork() creates a child process (Unix only).\n",
        "  - multiprocessing module works on all platforms and provides more control.\n",
        "\n",
        " 19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "  - It frees system resources.\n",
        "  - Ensures data is properly saved.\n",
        "  - Prevents file corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        " 20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline()?\n",
        "  - read() reads the entire file.\n",
        "  - readline() reads only one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        " 21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "  - Used to generate log messages and record program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        " 22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "  - Provides functions to interact with the operating system.\n",
        "  - Useful for file paths, directory creation, deletion, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        " 23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - Circular references.\n",
        "  - High memory usage due to dynamic typing.\n",
        "  - Unpredictable garbage collection timing.\n",
        "\n",
        " 24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "  - Use the raise keyword: raise ValueError(\"Error message\").\n",
        "\n",
        " 25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "  - Useful for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
